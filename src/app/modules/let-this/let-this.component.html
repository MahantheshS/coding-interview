    <b>Question</b>
    Difference between <b>let</b> and <b>this</b> Keywords.
    When to use each with examples.
    
    <b>let</b> is a new type of variable declaration in javascript.
    when a variable is declared with let it uses block-level scoping
    
    <b>This</b> is a keyword that referes to an object it is belonging to.
    In Function => this refers window object(with "use strict").
                => is undefined (without "use strict").
    In eventBinding => this refers to an element which received an event
    In objectmethod => this referes to owner of object method
    
    Following example shows how let and this can be used.

    export class LetThisComponent implements OnInit{{'{'}}
        personName : string = '';
         person = {{'{'}}
           name : "Mahanthesh",
           age : 26
        {{'}'}};
     
         ngOnInit(){{'{'}}
           let a = 10;//block level scope available only to ngOninit()
           this.letThisDemo();
           {{'{'}}
            let b = 11;
          {{'}'}}
         // console.log(b); can't acess b here
        {{'}'}}
     
         letThisDemo(){{'{'}}
          // this.a  // can't access a here
          this.personName = this.person.name;//'This' referes person Object here
        {{'}'}}
    {{'}'}}
